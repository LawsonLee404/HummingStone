It is a wonderful day at the Hummingstone corporation, and you are quite surprised that you haven’t snapped and killed everyone working there yet.
   Today you have been assigned to a new specimen, the Eyevy. You know it came from Spain, but you do not know which country you are in or came from. All you know is that you are at a facility of Hummingstone which you work for.

As it is only harmful when seen visually, we have turned the lights off for rooms that do not result in Finis Mundi, Multo Mortem, or Unum Occidere events at a lack of light.
